Project Description: Object Detection System
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an advanced Object Detection System capable of identifying and classifying objects within digital images or real-time video streams. This system will leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. The application of this technology spans various domains, including surveillance, autonomous driving, retail analytics, and more.

Objectives
Develop a Robust Object Detection Model: Create a model that can accurately detect and classify multiple objects within an image or video frame.
Ensure Real-Time Processing: Optimize the model and implementation to ensure it can process video frames in real-time.
Achieve High Accuracy: Strive for high precision and recall rates to minimize false positives and false negatives.
User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system, including capabilities for uploading images, streaming video, and visualizing results.
Deploy the System: Make the system easily deployable in various environments such as edge devices, cloud platforms, or local servers.
Key Features
Multi-Class Detection: Ability to detect multiple classes of objects simultaneously.
Real-Time Processing: Optimized for real-time performance on live video feeds.
Scalability: Capable of scaling from small edge devices to large cloud-based systems.
Robust Performance: Maintains high performance across diverse and challenging environments.
